  <h1 class="text-h2">About</h1>
  <h2 class="mb-1 grey text-h4 text-italic text-normal">Designer, Developer, and Strategist</h2>
  <p class="mb-1 text-h3">I’m a designer who’s passionate about uncovering what matters most to people and bringing it to life across digital and print. I thrive at the intersection of design and engineering&mdash;moving fluidly from client research, to shaping how an experience should look and feel, to the technical work required to build it.</p>
  <p style="column-count: 2;">My experience spans both small and large teams—from the tight-knit agency Inspired By Angie to the marketing team at Sweetwater. I also had the privilege of serving at the Sambodh Center for Human Excellence, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, where I transitioned into a leadership role in operations. Currently, I’m freelancing full-time, aligning my love of design and community development with projects for clients like the Community Foundation of Greater Fort Wayne and Patronicity. When I’m not designing, you’ll likely find me writing and producing music or walking and observing&nbsp;nature.</p>
